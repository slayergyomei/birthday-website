      <p class="heartfelt-message animate-in">Hi Namrata,<br />
      Happy Birthday. It’s one of those days, isn't it? A good moment to pause and just… celebrate you. I put this little website together because, well, I wanted to try and make your day a bit extra special. Hope you like it.<br /><br />
      It’s funny, when you wish someone a happy birthday, you try to cram all these good thoughts in. For you, I’m really hoping for more than just a 'happy day.' I’m hoping for a life that feels right, feels joyful. That you find success in the things that matter to you, that you feel a real sense of peace, and that your own unique spark just keeps on shining. You really do have a way of making things around you better, more interesting.<br /><br />
      I also wanted to say, from my side, my only real wish is to see you happy. Truly. Life can be weird, and sometimes words or actions don’t come out perfectly, but please know that my heart’s always in the right place when it comes to you – just wanting good things for you.<br /><br />
      So, as you kick off another year, I hope it’s filled with amazing moments, the kind you’ll look back on and smile. Lots of laughter, good people, and the feeling that you’re moving towards your dreams. You deserve all of that, and then some.<br /><br />
      You’re a pretty special person, Namrata.<br />
      Wishing you the very best birthday. Make it a good one.<br /><br />
      All the best</p>
